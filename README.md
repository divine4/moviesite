# Ticketsite Project
## Overview
  The objective of this project is to create a website that allows users to purchase movie tickets to the movies - Barbie and Oppenheimer. 
## Features
  - Movie Selection: User can select between Oppenheimer and Barbie using the dropdown menu.
  - Ticket Purchase: After selecting a movie, by clicking the "Get Ticket" button, the user is redirected to a new page displaying the movie image with ticket information such as cost, seat number,time, etc.
  - Error Page: If the user makes an incorrect selection, they are redirected to an error page, with a message that would guide them to choose between choices 1 and 2.
## Getting Started
  - Download a code editor (Ex: Vs code).
  - Create a folder for the project.
  - Create an 'index.html' file containing the movie selection.
  - Create a 'script.js' file for user interaction such as movie selection and redirection to page.
  - Create three different html files; one for oppenheimer ticket, barbie ticket, and error page.
## Customization
  The design and layout of the site were modified with CSS by creating a 'style.css' file, but for the barbie and oppenheimer ticket page, internal CSS was used for the background color.
